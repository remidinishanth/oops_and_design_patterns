### Variables
![](images/variables_in_java.png)

* Variables come in two flavors: primitive and reference
* Variable must always be declared with a name and a type.
* A primitive variable value is the bits representing the value (5, ‘a’,true, etc)
* A reference variable value is the bits representing a way to get to an object on the heap.
* A reference variable is like a remote control, using the dot operator (.) on a reference variable is like pressing a button on the remote control to a access a method or instance variable.
* A reference variable has a value of null when it is not referencing any object.
* An array is always an object, even if the array is declared to hold primitives.
