## Motivation

**Problem:**   Started with a simple SimUDuck App.

* Joe's company makes a duck pond simulation game, SimUDuck, The game can show a large variety of duck species swimming and making quacking sounds.

### But now we need the ducks to FLY

### First Design:
* Joe add a method `fly()` into the Duck class. It seem to work, but something went horribly wrong because not all ducks can fly.

What we got, Rubber ducks are also able to fly

**Drawbacks**
* A localized update to the code caused a nonlocal side effect (flying rubber ducks)!

### Second Design:
Using inheritance and polymorphism
* Always override the `fly()` mehtod in the subclass where needed.

**Drawbacks:** 
* Everytime a new duck is added, you will be forced to look at and possibly override `fly()` and `quack()`. 
* So is there a cleaner way of having only some of the duck types fly or quack?

### Third Idea

How about an interface?

**Drawbacks:** It completely destroy code reuse for those behaviors.

### Solution

1. Design Principles: **Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them form what stays the same!**
                               which means Encapsulate the parts that vary!
2. Design Principles: **Program to an interface, not an implementation!** (interface here means supertype! including interface
                               and abstract class!.. making use of the polymorphism functionality).
3. Design Principles:  **Favor composition over interface! **


* We know that not all of the subclasses should have flying or quacking behavior, so inheritance isnâ€™t the right answer. 
* But while having the subclasses implement Flyable and/or Quackable solves part of the problem (no inappropriately flying rubber ducks), it completely destroys code reuse for those behaviors, so it just creates a different maintenance nightmare.
* And of course there might be more than one kind of flying behavior even among the ducks that do fly...
