Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An **object** packages both data and
the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are typically called methods
or operations. An object performs an operation when it receives a request (or message)
from a client.

Requests are the only way to get an object to execute an operation. Operations are
the only way to change an object's internal data. Because of these restrictions, the
object's internal state is said to be **encapsulated**; it cannot be accessed directly, and its
representation is invisible from outside the object.

**Dynamic binding**:
The run-time association of a request to an object and one of its operations is known as
dynamic binding.
